SUMMARY

In case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill:

If you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction on
your bill, write us at P.O. Box 1377, Lewiston, Maine 04243-1377 as soon as
possible. We must hear from you no later than sixty (60) days after we sent you the
FIRST bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can telephone us, but doing
so will not preserve your rights. In your letter, give us the following information:

¢ Your name and account number.

¢ Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error.

If you need more information, describe the item you are unsure about.

You do not have to pay any amount in question while we are investigating, but you
are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question. While we
investigate your question, we cannot report you as delinquent or take any action to
collect the amount you question.

FINANCE CHARGES: Although the Bank uses the Daily Balance method to calculate
the finance charge on your Moneyline/Overdraft Protection account (the term "ODP"
or "OD" refers to Overdraft Protection), the Bank discloses the Average Daily Balance
on the periodic statement as an easier method for you to calculate the finance
charge. The finance charge begins to accrue on the date advances and other debits
are posted to your account and will continue until the balance has been paid in full.
To compute the finance charge, multiply the Average Daily Balance times the Days in
Period times the Daily Periodic Rate (as listed in the Account Summary section on
the front of the statement). The Average Daily Balance is calculated by adding the
balance for each day of the billing cycle, then dividing the total balance by the number
of Days in the Billing Cycle. The daily balance is the balance for the day after
advances have been added and payments or credits have been subtracted plus or
minus any other adjustments that might have occurred that day. There is no grace
period during which no finance charge accrues. Finance charge adjustments are
included in your total finance charge.
