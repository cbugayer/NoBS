CONSUMER BILLING RIGHTS SUMMARY REGARDING YOUR RESERVE LINE

What To Do If You Think You Find A Mistake on Your Statement

If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:

U.S. Bank, P.O. Box 3528, Oshkosh, WI 54903-3528.In your letter, give us the following information:

e Account information: Your name and account number.

e Dollar Amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.

e Description of problem: lf you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. You must contact us within 60 days after the
error appeared on your statement.

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.

While we investigate whether or not there has been an error, the following are true:

e We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.

e The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. But, if we determine that we made a mistake, you will not have to
pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.

e While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.

e Wecan apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.

Reserve Line Balance Computation Method: To determine your Balance Subject to Interest Rate, use the dates and balances provided in the Reserve Line Balance Summary
section. The date next to the first Balance Subject to Interest is day one for that balance and is applicable up to (but not including) the date of the next balance (if there is one). We multiply
the Balance Subject to Interest by the number of days it is applicable and add them up to get the same number of days in the billing cycle. We then divide the result by the number of billing
days in the cycle. This is your Balance Subject to Interest Rate. Any unpaid interest charges and unpaid fees are not included in the Balance Subject to Interest. The ***INTEREST
CHARGE*** begins from the date of each advance.

REPORTS TO AND FROM CREDIT BUREAUS FOR RESERVE LINES
We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.

CONSUMER REPORT DISPUTES

We may report information about account activity on consumer and small business deposit accounts and consumer reserve lines to Consumer Reporting Agencies (CRA). As a result, this
may prevent you from obtaining services at other financial institutions. If you believe we have inaccurately reported information to a CRA, you may submit a dispute by calling
844.624.82300r by writing to: U.S. Bank Attn: Consumer Bureau Dispute Handling (CBDH), P.O. Box 3447, Oshkosh, WI 54903-3447. In order for us to assist you with your dispute, you
must provide: your name, address and phone number; the account number; the specific information you are disputing; the explanation of why it is incorrect; and any supporting
documentation (e.g., affidavit of identity theft), if applicable.
