Information About Your Right to Dispute Errors

In case of errors or questions about your electronic transactions, call 1-800-VARO-526 or 1-800-827-6526, write to PO Box 71337,
Salt Lake City, UT 84171 or send an email at help@varomoney.com if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need
more information about a transaction listed in the statement or receipt. We must allow you to report an error until sixty (60) days after
the earlier of the date you electronically accessed your Varo Bank Account, if the error could be viewed in your electronic history, or
the date Varo sent the FIRST written history on which the error appeared. You may request a written history of your transactions at
any time by calling 1-800-VARO-526 or 1-800-827-6526 sending us an email at help@varomoney.com, or by writing to: PO Box
71337, Salt Lake City, UT 84171. You will need to provide us:

a. Your name, Varo Bank Account number and/or 16-digit Card number
b. Why you believe there is an error, and the dollar amount involved
c. Approximately when the error took place

If you provide this information orally, we may require that you send your complaint or question in writing within ten (10) business days.
We will determine whether an error occurred within ten (10) business days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly.
If we need more time, however, we may take up to forty-five (45) days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do
this, we will credit your Varo Bank Account within ten (10) business days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have use
of the money during the time it takes to complete the investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and you
do not provide it within ten (10) business days, we may not credit your Varo Bank Account. For errors involving new Varo Bank
Account, POS transactions or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to ninety (90) days to investigate your complaint or
question. For a new Varo Bank Account, we may take up to twenty (20) business days to credit your Varo Bank Account for the
amount you think is in error. We will tell you the results within three (3) business days after completing the investigation. If we decide
that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. Copies of the documentation used in the investigation may be obtained
by contacting us at the phone number or address shown at the beginning of this section. If you need more information about this
program’s error-resolution procedures, call 1-800-VARO-526.
