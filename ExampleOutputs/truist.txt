Important information about your Truist Ready Now Credit Line Account

Once advances are made from your Truist Ready Now Credit Line Account, an
INTEREST CHARGE will automatically be imposed on the account's outstanding
“Average daily balance.” The INTEREST CHARGE is calculated by applying the “Daily
periodic rate" to the ‘Average daily balance" of your account (including current
transactions) and multiplying this figure by the number of days in the billing cycle. To
get the “Average daily balance," we take the beginning account balance each day, add
any new advances or debits, and subtract any payments or credits and the last unpaid
INTEREST CHARGE. This gives us the daily balance. Then we add all of the daily
balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing
cycle. This gives us the ‘Average daily balance."
