IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR ACCOUNT
We may report information regarding your Account to credit bureaus. If the Account is jointly held, we may
also report information to credit bureaus about any joint owner(s). Negative information, including closing
of the Account with an overdrawn balance owed or other defaults on the Account, may be reflected in each
joint owner's credit report.
NEW CHOICE IN DOCUMENT DELIVERY FOR ONLINE BANKING CUSTOMERS
All Online Banking checking and savings customers will soon be able to choose between "Digital Delivery Only"
and "U.S. Mail Only" for eligible deposit servicing communications ("Documents").* Starting between October
23 and December 31, 2016, customers can make this selection from the Online Document Preferences screen on
the Customer Profile tab and may change this selection at any time. Please note that changes to delivery
preferences may take up to two business days to go into effect.
Selecting "Digital Delivery Only" for an account means we will post ("deliver") documents in PDF form on
PNC's secure Online Banking website. We will also send you an email notification that a new document is ready
to be viewed in Online Banking. Please ensure your Online Banking email address is up to date by signing on
and visiting the Customer Service tab. Documents that are delivered through Online Banking will no longer be
delivered by postal mail. For more information and answers to common questions, please consult PNC's Online
Banking Service Agreement or visit the Documents tab within the Customer Service section.
Selecting "U.S. Mail Only" for an account means we will mail the document, in paper form, to the last postal
address you have specified for your Account.
