If you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer on the statement or receipt, we must hear from you no later than 60 days* after we sent you
the FIRST statement on which the error or problem appeared. Telephone us at the number listed on the front of this statement or write to us at U.S. Bank P.O. Box 64991 St. Paul, MN
55164-9505.
Tell us your name and account number.
Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe there is an error or why you need more information.
Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.
We will tell you all the results of our investigation within 10 business days and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint.
In that case, we will provisionally credit your account for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.
For transfers initiated outside the United States or transfers resulting from point of sale debit card transactions, the time period for provisional credit is 10 business days and the time to
resolve the investigation is 90 days.
     *Please note: Paper draft and paper check claims must be disputed within 30 days per Your Deposit Account Agreement.
Errors related to any transaction on a business account will be governed by any agreement between us and/or all applicable rules and regulations governing such transactions, including the
rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA Rules) as may be amended from time to time.  If you think this statement is wrong, please telephone us at the number
listed on the front of this statement immediately.
If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:
U.S. Bank, P.O. Box 3528, Oshkosh, WI 54903-3528.
In your letter, give us the following information:
 Your name and account number.
 The dollar amount of the suspected error.
If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.
You must contact us within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.
You must notify us of any potential errors
. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error, the following are true:
We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. But, if we determine that we made a mistake, you will not have to
pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.
  To determine your
, use the dates and balances provided in the Reserve Line Balance Summary section.
The date next to the first Balance Subject to Interest is day one for that balance and is applicable up to (but not including) the date of the next balance (if there is one). We multiply the
Balance Subject to Interest by the number of days it is applicable and add them up to get the same number of days in the billing cycle. We then divide the result by the number of billing
days in the cycle. This is your
.  Any unpaid interest charges and unpaid fees are not included in the Balance Subject to Interest.  The ***INTEREST
CHARGE*** begins from the date of each advance.
We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.
We may report information about negative account activity on consumer and small business deposit accounts and consumer reserve lines to Consumer Reporting Agencies (CRA). As a
result, this may prevent you from obtaining services at other financial institutions. If you believe we have inaccurately reported information to a CRA, you may submit a dispute by calling
844.624.8230 or by writing to: U.S. Bank Attn: CRA Management, P.O. Box 3447, Oshkosh, WI 54903-3447. In order for us to assist you with your dispute, you must provide: your name,
address and phone number; the account number; the specific information you are disputing; the explanation of why it is incorrect; and any supporting documentation (e.g., affidavit of
identity theft), if applicable.
