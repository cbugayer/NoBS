Ideas:
 Make C.clean_date much cleaner by
    using capturing groups instead of non-capturing groups, to get the date directly from the resulting tuple
    perhaps with no need to check tuple length - removing .split(), len() == 3 check, and raising exception
 Logs file: 
    - If error, log the error message traceback
    


To Reform:
 - move ipynb to txt stuff to main()

Potential Issues:
! Maybe manually get all the results and check if the code gets the same results
! If there may be european dates, we should either account for them or just not allow them.
 - If we don't allow them, we should have the regex accept them and just check the date in check_month_day_year

Speficic Questions:

 ? Member share saving account # or checking account # (did checking account #) 
  - Should not come up. Perhaps delete Becu files

 - potential issues
 - assumptions
    - no european dates
    - max and min years
    - 2 digit years are 2000s
