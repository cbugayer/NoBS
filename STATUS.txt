Ideas:
 Make C.clean_date much cleaner by
    using capturing groups instead of non-capturing groups, to get the date directly from the resulting tuple
    perhaps with no need to check tuple length - removing .split(), len() == 3 check, and raising exception
 Logs file: 
    - If error, log the error message traceback
    


To Reform:
 - move ipynb to txt stuff to main()

Potential Issues:
! Maybe manually get all the results and check if the code gets the same results
! If there may be european dates, we should either account for them or just not allow them.
 - If we don't allow them, we should have the regex accept them and just check the date in check_month_day_year


Notes:
   !!! PYMUPDF has a table extraction function
   gonna try to delete every blank line in the txt files

General Questions:


Speficic Questions:
 becu_1
  Multiple account numbers (savings and checking)
 us_1 and us_2 
  Seems like they overwrote account numbers, resulting in invisible account numbers pymupdf picks up
 regions_1



ReadMe Info:
 - what the code does
 - how to run the code
    - the input
    - the output    
 - potential issues
 - assumptions
    - no european dates
    - max and min years
    - 2 digit years are 2000s
