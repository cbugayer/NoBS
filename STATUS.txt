Ideas:
 Make C.clean_date much cleaner by
    using capturing groups instead of non-capturing groups, to get the date directly from the resulting tuple
    perhaps with no need to check tuple length - removing .split(), len() == 3 check, and raising exception
 Be error resistant - if a file fails output in logs file 
    different error messages for different types of errors



To Reform:
 - get_digits next_line function
 - main()

Potential Issues:
! Maybe manually get all the results and check if the code gets the same results
! If there may be european dates, we should either account for them or just not allow them.
 - If we don't allow them, we should have the regex accept them and just check the date in check_month_day_year

Speficic Questions:

 ? Member share saving account # or checking account # (did checking account #) 
  - Should not come up. Perhaps delete Becu files
