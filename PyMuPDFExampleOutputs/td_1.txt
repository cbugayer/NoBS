FOR CONSUMER ACCOUNTS ONLY — IN CASE OF ERRORS OR
QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS:
If you need information about an electronic fund transfer or if you believe there is an
error on your bank statement or receipt relating to an electronic fund transfer,
telephone the bank immediately at the phone number listed on the front of your
statement or write to:
TD Bank, N.A., Deposit Operations Dept, P.O. Box 1377, Lewiston,
Maine 04243-1377
We must hear from you no later than sixty (60) calendar days after we sent you the
first statement upon which the error or problem first appeared. When contacting the
Bank, please explain as clearly as you can why you believe there is an error or why
more information is needed. Please include:
•
Your name and account number.
•
A description of the error or transaction you are unsure about.
•
The dollar amount and date of the suspected error.
When making a verbal inquiry, the Bank may ask that you send us your complaint in
writing within ten (10) business days after the first telephone call.
We will investigate your complaint and will correct any error promptly. If we take more
than ten (10) business days to do this, we will credit your account for the
amount you think is in error, so that you have the use of the money during the time it
takes to complete our investigation.
INTEREST NOTICE
Total interest credited by the Bank to you this year will be reported by the Bank to the
Internal Revenue Service and State tax authorities. The amount to be reported will be
reported separately to you by the Bank.
FOR CONSUMER LOAN ACCOUNTS ONLY — BILLING RIGHTS
SUMMARY
In case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill:
If you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction on
your bill, write us at P.O. Box 1377, Lewiston, Maine 04243-1377 as soon as
possible. We must hear from you no later than sixty (60) days after we sent you the
FIRST bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can telephone us, but doing
so will not preserve your rights. In your letter, give us the following information:
•
Your name and account number.
•
The dollar amount of the suspected error.
•
Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error.
If you need more information, describe the item you are unsure about.
You do not have to pay any amount in question while we are investigating, but you
are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question. While we
investigate your question, we cannot report you as delinquent or take any action to
collect the amount you question.
FINANCE CHARGES: Although the Bank uses the Daily Balance method to calculate
the finance charge on your Moneyline/Overdraft Protection account (the term "ODP"
or "OD" refers to Overdraft Protection), the Bank discloses the Average Daily Balance
on the periodic statement as an easier method for you to calculate the finance
charge. The finance charge begins to accrue on the date advances and other debits
are posted to your account and will continue until the balance has been paid in full.
To compute the finance charge, multiply the Average Daily Balance times the Days in
Period times the Daily Periodic Rate (as listed in the Account Summary section on
the front of the statement). The Average Daily Balance is calculated by adding the
balance for each day of the billing cycle, then dividing the total balance by the number
of Days in the Billing Cycle. The daily balance is the balance for the day after
advances have been added and payments or credits have been subtracted plus or
minus any other adjustments that might have occurred that day. There is no grace
period during which no finance charge accrues. Finance charge adjustments are
included in your total finance charge.
