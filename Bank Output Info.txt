Ideas:
 Why not have a standardized date finding function that uses regex to get dates
 Check for date format using a format regex and then get the actual date using a date regex

Research:
 - Try Catch and the call stack
 - __pycache__ folder purpose

Potential Issues:
! Before getting splitting start_date to [month, day, year], check if len(start_date) == 3
