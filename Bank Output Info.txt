Ideas:
 capital_one_1.py will be the prototype for date ranges. eventually we can have general files that use ranges and separate start/end dates
 why not truncate to the first 3 letters of the month and have remove full month names from MONTH_DICT? 
 lowercase MONTH_DICT keys
 loop through all date patterns to find the right one



Consistencies:
 - ally_1 and bank_of_america_2 dates start with "beginning balance" and account numbers start with "account number:"
 - bank_of_america_1 and bmo_1 dates start with "period" and account numbers start with "card number"

 

Potential Issues:
! Before getting splitting start_date to [month, day, year], check if len(start_date) == 3
! Perhaps we should check EVERY line and check for any inconsistencies like 2 different date ranges. would performance take a hit?

Notes:
 - capital_one_1 and capital_one_2 are identical

General Questions:


ally_1
? Opening Date or beginning balance date (did beginning balance date)

becu_1
? Member share saving account # or checking account # (did checking account #)



Done:
    Why not have a standardized date finding function that uses regex to get dates
    Check for date format using a format regex and then get the actual date using a date regex
        findall gets the dates from the format and with a litle cleaning we can get the actual date
    
    
    zeros in output (2002.02.03 or 2002.2.3)
        doesn't matter to k, will include zeros
